# Lab3-Angular

The goal of this assignment is increase your familiarity with Angular in general through building a simple application. This lab will focus specifically on using custom directives and their power. While it is possible to copy and paste through it, you'll be better off if you actually type it out and work through it with the tutorial located here:

Once you have finished the tutorial, add a way for users to include their email address.

For your submission, please submit a URL to learningsuite where your lab is running live. You should utilize [this link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/edffedb649402e571af82e1f692100c4) to get started. We will be looking through the code, so we'll know if you simply copy/paste all of the tutorial.
